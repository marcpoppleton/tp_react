He was also presumed the father of Jon Snow, whose mother is believed to be the common-born serving girl Wylla. Ned was a very honorable, honest, and dutiful man.

As Lord of Winterfell, he wielded Ice, the two-handed, ancestral sword of House Stark."

When her father agreed to become the new Hand of the King, a marriage proposal was arranged to wed Sansa to King Robert's heir apparent, Joffrey Baratheon. Despite the obvious truth, Sansa believed Joffrey to be kind and brave. Her direwolf, Lady, was put to death on the King's Road after Arya Stark's direwolf, Nymeria, attacked Prince Joffrey.

She is adventurous and enjoys sword fighting and archery over more traditionally ladylike pursuits, and because of this, she and her sister Sansa are often in disagreement. Arya was born and raised at Winterfell, and accompanied her father and sister to King's Landing. On the way there, she asks a young butcher boy, Mycah, to practice sword fighting with her. They are discovered by her sister and Prince Joffrey Baratheon; the latter of whom decided to bully and beat on Mycah. Arya's direwolf, Nymeria, attacks Joffrey by biting his arm. Arya then takes Joffrey's sword, tossing it into the river nearby, and fleeing the scene with Nymeria. Knowing that Joffrey would have her direwolf killed, she urges her pet to run away. When questioned, Sansa lies about what happened to protect Joffrey, who claims Mycah and Arya attacked him and set her wolf on him. This causes King Robert to sentence a direwolf to death on the request of his wife, Cersei Lannister. Since Nymeria is gone, Sansa's wolf, Lady, is killed instead.

Some time later, Benjen Stark re-emerged to save Bran Stark and Meera Reed from wights, wielding flaming lantern on a chain. Benjen revealed that he was attacked by White Walkers, but was saved by the Children of the Forest, who used a shard of dragonglass to prevent him from becoming a wight. Benjen also revealed that due to his semi-undead state, he can no longer travel south of the Wall, as the Wall has ancient spells carved into it that prevent undead from passing through. Benjen departed, vowing to continue to fight the dead for as long as he could."
